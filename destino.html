            This work aims to develop a critical capacity for the historical and cultural framing of different languages and practices in communication design, such as issues of composition, assembly, and fragmentation of a visual and textual message through typography, based on a project-based methodology grounded in experimentation and the development of a consistent visual and conceptual dimension.

            Throughout our project, we encountered various challenges. Gradually, we moved closer to what we aimed to achieve, shaping our ideas through numerous conversations with professors and group discussions. We ultimately decided to project our ideas onto a chess game, as it evokes the same notions of destiny and the past. Just as a game has its history and trajectory, the destiny mentioned in our final sentence also shares these characteristics.

                To carry out the work, we used an acrylic table where we placed the projector vertically, thus creating a secure support that lasted throughout the production of the video and the images. In the end, as a group, we agreed that the project required a lot of creativity both for the projection and for the projected body. In this way, we learned more and explored new ideas and paths as artists and designers.
